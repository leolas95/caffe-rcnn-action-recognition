- Add faster rcnn joint train and test \[DONE\]
- Add action recognition \[DONE\]
- Add spatial transform network \[Not Started\]
- Speed up\[DOING\]
- With demos including all tasks above \^_\^

## Faster RCNN End-To-End

### Disclaimer
The official Faster R-CNN code (written in MATLAB) is [available](https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn) here. If your goal is to reproduce the results in our NIPS 2015 paper, please use the [official](https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn) code.

This repository contains a C++ reimplementation of the Python code([py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn)). This C++ implementation is built on the offcial [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), I will continue to update this code for improvement and up-to-date by offcial caffe.

All following steps, you should do these in the $CAFFE\_ROOT path.

### Demo
Using **sh example/FRCNN/demo.sh**, the will process five pictures in the examples/FRCNN/images , and put results into examples/FRCNN/results .

Note: You should prepare the trained caffemodel into models/FRCNN/ as ZF\_faster\_rcnn\_final.caffemodel

### Train
Using **sh example/FRCNN/train.sh**, the will start train voc2007 data using ZF model.

- VOCdevkit should be put into $CAFFE\_ROOT, ** ln -s $YOUR\_VOCdevkit\_Path $CAFFE\_ROOT/VOCdevkit
- ZF pretrain model should be put into models/FRCNN/ as ZF.v2.caffemodel

### Commands, Rebase From Caffe Master

- git remote add caffe https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
- git fetch caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.
